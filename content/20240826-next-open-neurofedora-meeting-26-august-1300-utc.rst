Please join us at the next regular Open NeuroFedora team meeting on Monday 26 August at 1300 UTC.
The meeting is a public meeting, and open for everyone to attend.
You can join us in the `Fedora meeting channel on chat.fedoraproject.org (our Matrix instance) <https://matrix.to/#/#meeting:fedoraproject.org>`__.
Note that you can also access this channel from other Matrix home severs, so you do not have to create a Fedora account just to attend the meeting.

Or, you can also use this command in the terminal:
